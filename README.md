Overview
In this project, I have created a JavaScript function that checks if the user has entered valid pet adoption details using syntax-engine interaction to take a string as an input and validates it if it follows a specific syntax such that it starts with a "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. if the input follows the syntax the results will be "Valid Syntax" and if it does not, the results will be "Invalid Syntax".
Reflections
Area of mastery: Creating a function, setting conditions for the 'if statement' and the 'else statement' and making sure it functions well.
Challenge faced
At first my string was functioning for panctuation marks as well, and I had to refine it to strictly using alphanumeric conditions.
My red and green icons were not showing, I tried using them as emojis but the colors were not the same as the one on the brief, ultimately I had to code for them in css and JavaScript.
Areas of improvement
Getting comfortable with making string functions, setting clear conditions.

Overall Learning Experience
This Project was very confusing at first, but eventually got to understand it a bit, it has helped me structure my understanding JavaScript fundamentals and I am looking forward to building on these skills in future projects.
